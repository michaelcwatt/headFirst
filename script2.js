// guessing what each line of code does//

    //var price = 28.99 - it creates a variable called price and stores a number in it.
    // var discount = 10 - creating another variable called discount and storing 10 in it.
    // var total = price-(price*(discount/100)) -this takes discount devides by 100 times price by that and deducts price by that.
    // it the total is over 25 run next line 
    // free shipping() this calls free shipping function. 
    // creates a cariable called count and stores 10 in it.
    // conditional statment if count is more than 0 run the next line of code 
    // calls the juggle function 
    //removes one from count.
    //creates variable called dog assigned some sort of holding thing for name and weight
    //if dog weight is more than 30 then run next line 
    //displays alert saying woof woof else run next line 
    // alert on page saying woof woof.
    //creates variable circleRadious and puts 20 in it
